## üìù Project Description

This repository hosts the **core logic engine** for a role-playing game (RPG) battle system. The project focuses on code architecture to efficiently handle the sequence of events, damage calculation, and statistical interaction between characters (heroes) and enemies.
 

## üöÄ Technologies and Languages

The project is developed with a web-based structure for easy demonstration:

* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Implementation of the battle logic, including classes for entity management.
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Used for the basic structure of the simulator or the visualization interface.

## ‚ú® Features and Implemented Logic

The battle engine includes robust logic for the following elements:

1. **Turn-Based System:**
* Implementation of an action queue that determines the attack order of all entities (heroes and enemies) based on the Speed/Initiative statistic.

2. **Entity Model:**
* Definition of clear classes or data structures for characters and enemies, including essential attributes such as **HP (Life)**, **MP (Mana/Resources)**, **Attack**, and **Defense**.

3. **Damage Calculation Algorithm:**
* Function that processes the interaction between the attacker's attack and the target's defense.
* Handling random variables to simulate the **Luck** factor or the probability of a **Critical Hit**.

4. **Battle State:**
* Logic to monitor victory or defeat conditions (e.g., when a team's HP reaches zero).

* This is just one part of a larger project.

* Here is the complete project I was doing with a collaborator: https://github.com/Starling74?tab=repositories
