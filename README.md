The project uses a semantic HTML5 structure with the following main components:

HUD (Heads-Up Display): Top navigation controls

Arena: Background where the battle takes place

Characters: Neo (player) and Rival (enemy)

Status Bars: HP and stats information

Action Interface: Buttons to control the character

This is not the complete project, this is just a part of testing.
